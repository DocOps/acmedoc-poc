= Framework Structure
:page-permalink: '{site_path}/framework-structure'

An implementation of LiquiDoc CMF such as ACMEdoc starts with a core architecture made up of the directories and files listed below.

ifdef::pdf[]
include::{includes_path}/built/framework-structure-table.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifndef::pdf[]
include::{includes_path}/built/framework-structure-dlist.adoc[]
endif::[]

[TIP]
In the PDF edition of this document, the above appears as a table; in the website edition, it is a definition list.
Both are drawn from the same source (`data/framework-structure.yml`), which is parsed using the generic templates `terms-to-table.asciidoc` and `terms-to-dlist.asciidoc`, each generating a file in the ephemeral directory `build/includes/built/` (those being `framework-strcture-table.adoc` and `framework-structure-dlist.adoc`).
